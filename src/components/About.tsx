                        I am a product professional who thrives on ownership and execution.
                        In a world of noise, I bring clarity. I focus on what matters: shipping real value, aligning stakeholders, and building sustainable processes.

                    <p>
                        My approach is rooted in calm leadership—navigating ambiguity without chaos.
                        Whether it's zero-to-one product development or scaling existing systems, I ensure that strategy translates into delivery.
